Director's:

In small companies, share holders run the company directly but some share-holders only want to invest money, not run a company

Company law says that share-holders appoint director's to run the company on their behalf

In small companies, the shareholders may actually be directors 

In large companies, the shareholders don't even know who directors are

Director have obligations:

-Company employees

-Share-Holders

Board of Directors:

Members of board can be:

-Elected

-Appointed after interview

Directors jointly oversee the activites of a company

Board of Directors, Board of Governers, Board of Trustees e.t.c are same thing

There are two tier board in Euro/Asia countries:

-Executive Board: supervises Day-To-Day business through Managers

-Supervisory Board: supervises the Executive Board

The sytem of board of directors of different companies:

-Amazon

-Google

-Facebook

-Mircrosoft

-Apple

-Oracle

Directors:

dicrectors must act in good faith for the benefit of company

Case 1:


You are a director of a
company that writes software.
Someone approaches you to
have some very small
software written.
–
Option A: You realize you can
write software in your spare
time so your employees can do
other important stuff for the
company.

Option B: You put the small
software in the pipeline for your
employees to complete just like
any other project. – Option B: You keep quiet because the
supplier is qualified to get the
contract and it will not be fair to
deny them the contract because they
are related to you.

– Option C: …. any ideas … ?


Case 2:

You are a director of a company
who is about to make a contract
with a supplier. The supplier is
related to you, or is your friend.
The supplier has already been
shortlisted to be amongst the best
and most reasonable of other
suppliers.

– Option A: You tell the company that
supplier is your friend/relative and
hence cannot be selected.

– Option B: You put the small
software in the pipeline for your
employees to complete just like
any other project. – Option B: You keep quiet because the
supplier is qualified to get the
contract and it will not be fair to
deny them the contract because they
are related to you.

– Option C: …. any ideas … ? – Option C: … any ideas .. ?

Answer for Case 1:

Option B: You put the small
software in the pipeline for
your employees to complete
just like any other project.

Not doing so will suggest
to other employees that
director has some personal
interest (even though
there was none)

This way everything will
be more transparent.

Answer for Case 2:

Option A but with
modification: You tell the
board of directors that
supplier is your
friend/relative and hence
refrain from voting when
the matter is discussed

Known as Declaring
Conflict of Interest

What if every director
has a conflict of interest?

External obligations of director:

Responsibilites of supervisory boards

-Beaware of company's financial position

-preparation of annual report

-ensure company complies with all provision of law:

if law is breached, company will be prosecuted for violation of law, but in some cases, directors can be made personally for breach

executive director vs non-executive director:

executive director: is also employee for company

non-executive director: only works in advisory capacity to the company

-attend all montly board meetings, with equal importance as executive directors

-paid a fee for their services

-they have same role as executive directors but may be given some additional tasks such as "Determining an executive directors tankhwa"

company secretary:

-responsible for keeping various record

-responsible for handling paper-work and administration issues with SCEP

-secretary is often a director (most common in small companies)

-larger companies hire outside staff, usually: accountants

structure and management of organizations:

how is work shared b/w employees and/or directors of the company

how people are grouped?

who reports to whom?

objectives of an organization structure:

-facilitates flow of information: so to facilitate directors in decision making

-facilitates effective co-ordination:

-pooled inter-dependence:

components are independent and only contribute financially to the company

-sequential inter-dependence:

one component has to complete its function before next component perform it. (e.g system developers complete product before testers can do their job)

-reciprocal inter-dependence:

unit-a output becomes the input of unit-b and unit-b output becomes input of unit-a

why objectives of an organization structure?

answer: so organizations will:

-allocate resources

-allocate people

to make this structure operate smoothly

hierarical structure:

-all tasks are split up into specialized jobs

-performance of each task is governed by precise rules

-all communications and tasks will be done "impersonally" and in "formal" manner

hierarchial structure:

-recruitment: based on identification of new task

-promotion: based on senority and/or achivement

-dismissal: nobody can dismiss employee arbitrarily

hierarical structure follows "structure by function" approach where all task are accumulated to represent "core functions" of an organization

each unit of tasks will be headed by one and only one manager

hierarhical structure:

-appropriate for small organizations

-simple and easy for each department to understand their responsibilities

-easy to hold a particular department accountable if something goes wrong

structure by geograph:

mostly applied to multi-national companies

-legal presence(registered company,tax registered)

-physical presence(in terms of offices)

-market presence(sales/marketing staff,trained in local language and cultral factors)

cons of this structure:

-may lead to function duplication

-work servies and process may differ from area to area

-no unified culture in organization

-coordination challanges due to distance

structure by product line:

organization arranges itself on basis of different products/services that they provide

structure by technology:

have divison based on technologies:

divions on the basis of:

artifical intelligence department

database department

cyber security department

issues:

-customer req may be of differeny technologies

-software developers may have expertise belonging to more than one technology. Under which structure they operate and report to?

-sales/marketing staff will have problems in guessing which clients to refer to which technology

matrix structure:

used to mix roles of differnt organizations components (very difficult to manage)

-unclear decision making(two bosses which one to follow)

-two bosses (which one to report)

-accountability(which one is accountable)

depth of structure:

-depth of structure (DOS): maximum number of layers in an organization hierarchy

-managerial control span (MCS): number of people that report to a manager

Centralization vs Decentralization:

centralized:

-rules from the top must be followed

-benefit: programmers can easily be moved from one part of company to another

-drawback: you cannot use another language/db even if it was much better than the company choice

decentralized:

-rules from the top can be followed (may be adapted locally if required)

-benefit: use the most suitable tools for each project

-drawback: maintainence nightmare+may also result in a large part of un-documented code using old technologies

slide 06:

-who pays this money? venture capitalists (companies) or business angels (individuals) pay this money

-both help the company to expand and become successful. When target is achieved, they sell their share of ownership at very high prices.

-will therefore occupy a permanent role in decision-making inside the company

-how do the equity firms get so much money??

equity company itself borrows money through bands (who want to co-invest) or through inviting people to invest in its stocks

Exercise
● A company is in need of finances.
● You have $$$, and you want to help.
● Should you give the $$$ to them as loan,
or should you purchase their shares?

Exercise
●Share-holders have greater risk of lower returns as
compared to lenders (They may lose their worth
entirely).
●Share-holders have greater profit margins than lenders
if all goes well.

SCENARIO: DO it from the slides

Leverage:

-if a company has taken LOANS + Equity Capital, then difference b/w both is called leverage (or gearing)

-shareholders: Not happy with loans because mosts of the money will be going to pay loan interests

-lenders: Not happy because they know share-holders may encourage company to trade RECKLESSLY (no profit means no loan repayment)

-New Lenders: will not invest in a heavily leveraged company

How do we measure History??

-seasonal and planetary motions

-relative to occurence of important events (social,religious) e.g Hijra,AD,BC,ascension of a king, creation of a nation

-lifespan of certain people or dynasties (victorian era, ayub khan era, ming and qing dynasties, mongol and mughal empires, e.t.c)

-cirumstances,arts and technology 

Development of systems to record events, and hence accumulate and transmit information about the past

Pre-history: A history where such recording systems were not available, or not in practice

SOCIAL FABRIC----------------------------------------------

history:

human progress and welfare depends mostly on the successful and efficient management of information

Steps for progress:

discovery and design----Process and Manage-----Applyy---Then again to discovery and design and so on

information technology evolved from,

recording systems-to-communication systems-to-processing systems

with this evolution, advanced economies are highlu dependent of their functioning and growth upon,

-information based sources

-information based services (communication,finance and entertainment)

-information based public sectors (education,administration,health-care)

Information and communication technologies have changed the world

1-Deeply

2-Irreversibly

3-Problematically

few points are there for information

-management,storage and retrieval of this informaton

-utilization of information

-communication of information

-computation on information (analyzing this information)

Analogy of Tree: technology growth, weak branches, lead to chaos and fragile growth

To minimize chaos and fragile growth,

-develop strong philosopy and ethical use of information

-understand less visible implications of information overload

-understand impact of information on human and environmental welfare

-anticipate difficulties

-identify opportunities

-resolve problems

-resolve conflicts

-resolve dilemmas

Ethics:

branch of philosphy: studies objective and rational background of thought and actions

normative ethics: moral code on how one should react, give certain situation (virtue ethics) e.g, distinguishes between right and wrong

applied ethics: what to do given a specific situation

-de-ontological-ethics: ethics towards duties

-information-ethics: specifies related to ICT

Ethics: Moral Code:

set of rules established by society 

established boundaries of generally accepted behaviour (what people should and should not do)

different rules of society can be contradictory 

– A very good friend copies in Exam
Should you tell the truth to authorities
Should you be loyal to your friend
which is more important?

– Employer monitoring employee Internet usage
Is it good ethics (employer wanting more productivity)
or violation of privacy of employee
which is more important?

ethics:morality:

social conventions about right/wrong

conventions which are so established there is no writen consensus

varies with age,cultrul group,ethnic background,religion,gender

most socieites have uniform agreement upon: 

crime,murder,theft,arson is immoral

what about:

-placing parents in an old house

-attitude towards illegal copying of software/movies

Aristotle's Meta-Physical & Physiological
explanation of Human Behavior

●Every physical entity in the Universe is made out of
matter and forms (information).

●All animals are information-processing beings (including
humans) whose bodily structures account for the ways in
which information gets processed within them.

●Information processing within an animal’s body initiates
and controls the animal’s behavior

●Humans have additional sophisticated information-
processing capabilities called theoretical reasoning and
practical reasoning. These added capabilities make ethics
possible.

information agents:

difference b/w online and offline life

agent of ethics:

proactive agents: plan and initiate actions responsibly in anticipation of future events

reactive agents: perform responsible actions oncee an event has occured

Value System:

scheme of moral values:

-virtue: habits of inclining people to do what is acceptable( depends of social fabric) e.g fairness,generosity,honesty,loyalty

-vice: habits of unacceptable behaviour e.g vanity,greed,envy,anger,criminal behaviour

Integrity:

monitoring of communications

ambient intelligence problems

Computer Crime and Viruses:

sophistication of attacks vs expertise required

computer un-reliability:

industrial societies becomming more technology dependent

very little is known about global impact of computer failure over time

what are the sources of computer failure?

-total failure vs partial failure

-thorough testing not possible 

case: automated vehicles vs automated aircraft..why different??

artificial intelligence:

should machines make decisions?

autonomous robots/vehicles?

are ethical robots possible?

WAR:

smart weapons
